# Milestone Project 1

## A Website for a Muscle Therapy company!


This is my first milestone project. I have decided to create a webpage for a friend as a project. His firm does different health treatments.
This project includes interactivity and ease of use. It is easy to navigate, easy to understand and has been testet by several people before publishing.

The project will include:
* a fixed navbar in the top with navigational links
* 3 different languages: EN, NO, GER
* integrated email sending
* hyperlinks
* fixed navbar
* functionality both on small and big screens

I will be using the following CDN's and frameworks:
- bootstrap
- fontawesome
- smtpjs.com
- hover.css

## UX

This project is made for a new company that is just starting to get of their feet. This webpage is simple. yet intuitive and with enough information to be able to understand what the purpose of the company is. Since this company has a lot of different people and is located in Oslo, the webpage has also been translated into different languages. 

The company provides different services but all centered around a health aspect, if it is training, food advise or the healing of sore muscles, they will be able to help you with either one or all of these things!

The easy to use contact form is also a nice addition for people to contact the company directly without any hassle.

* as a user i'd like an easy to use webpage with easy navigation.
* I will always prefer to be able to send a mail through the webpage or otherwise contact them than having to talk to them by phone
* It is important to have enough information to be able to answer all your questions but not to much information so that you spend a lot of time reading on the page.


These are my 2 wireframes that i made during the start of my project but i deviated greatly by changing the purpose and layout of the page. I had a friend that wanted a webpage and i used him as a reference in order how he would like his webpage to look and i therefore didnt create any new wireframe for the new webpage. My friend was giving me input throughout the project and i changed things after every time we reviewed the page together.

## Features

* The navbar is fixed on top and allows for ease-of-use. It is easy to understand, intuitive and fixed on the top so that you never loose your navigation. You never have to use the browser buttons in order to go anywhere on the page.
* The carousel is also for easier navigation but at the same time offers some insight in the different things the webpage wants you to look at.
* Under the carousel there are some links which for now mostly are there for navigation but i would've liked having a type of carousel under that that instead of going to the new html file when clicking on the link, rather slides in a snippet of the most important information of the other html page.
* the contact form allows for easy communication and not everybody likes opening their mail interface on their own machine in order to send mails. Having a webpage integrated mail system makes it easier for people to use.
* The footer is interactive, doesnt take much space and has all the neccesarry information and links in order to showcase the company. (here i used my own links since i do not have any for a hypothetical company)

I would've liked to implement a type of carousel under my horizontal images in order to slide in information.
A nice logo with a name of the company would make it easier to understand for people what they are looking at.
navbar collapsing out from right to left while beeing under 576px screenwidth.
I would've used hover.css but i somehow didn't think it would fit to much on the webpage.

#Technologies Used

I have only used:
* bootstrap
    * for the general layout of the project
* smtp.js
    * for the implementation of contact-form email sending on the webpage
* Fontawesome
    * for general use of icons

## Testing

For testing purposes I had uploaded the site and put it live almost immediately so that i could send the link to 2 of my friends. They checked it throughout my time coding and always when i asked them to. They tried pressing and going on different stuff and gave me feedback so that i could change and fix things. This was of enourmous help since they often came with new ideas or saw problems that i didn't notice.

I have been constantly using developer tools in chrome in order to make the screen size smaller, check the layout of the different devices and in general see things that shouldn't happen.

Visual Studio Code is my go to IDE which also helps checking mistakes in syntax and in general tells you if there is some code that is wrong.

I specifically clicked on all the links and all the forms and made sure everything works as intended.

My project is based mainly on bootstrap code and is therefore very responsive, at the same time as i have been constantly checking to change the screen size in order to find any misplacement of columns or weird object interactions.

Since i am writing this code on visual studio, I always tested my changes before commiting them to github.

## Deployment

I created my repository on github and then immediately started hosting it on github pages since i sent that link to friends in order for them to give me feedback.

* there are no different versions. Only one old version which i abandoned when i changed the idea of my project.
* There are also no differences since this is the only version that i used. There are only differences between my local version on visual code and my github pages version before i commit the changes.
